    <p>When does SEPAL use end user information from third parties?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>SEPAL will collect End User Data necessary to provide the SEPAL services to our customers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>End users may voluntarily provide us with information they have made available on social media websites. If you
        provide us with any such information, we may collect publicly available information from the social media
        websites you have indicated. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by
        visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When does SEPAL use customer information from third parties?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email
        address to us to show interest in becoming a SEPAL customer, we receive information from a third party that
        provides automated fraud detection services to SEPAL. We also occasionally collect information that is made
        publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites
        make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non-personal, with third parties such as
        advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and marketing partners, and others who provide our content or whose
        products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our current and future affiliated
        companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business
        reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our
        successors-in-interest.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as
        hosting and maintaining our servers and the app, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage
        marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may
        purchase through the app. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal
        information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties
        such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be
        used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited
        the app in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the app. They may aggregate information about
        our advertising and what you see on the app and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our
        advertisers. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials
        or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to
        claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the
        safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity,
        or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>SEPAL will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you
        from third parties as described above.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>By submitting your email address on this app, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your
        participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe
        option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact
        them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate
        spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address
        for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people
        who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing
        page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If,
        however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes
        stated in this Policy. Note: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we
        include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide SEPAL to you and fulfill the purposes described in
        this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services
        on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply
        with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we
        can't identify you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>How Do We Protect Your Information?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an
        order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied
        sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our
        Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such
        systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information
        (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or
        warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to SEPAL or guarantee that your information on the
        Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or
        managerial safeguards.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>SEPAL is incorporated in India. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or
        from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third
        parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries
        that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest
        extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border
        transfer and hosting of such information.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Is the information collected through the SEPAL Service secure?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial
        procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your
        information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In
        addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we
        use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If
        applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that
        intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Can I update or correct my information?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information SEPAL collects depend on your
        relationship with SEPAL. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company
        employment policies.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable
        information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable
        information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from
        us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the
        following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no
        effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your
        privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your
        identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the
        secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information
        you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent
        loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible
        for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we
        actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate,
        as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by
        contacting the organization of which you are a customer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Personnel</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you are a SEPAL worker or applicant, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us. We use the
        information collected for Human Resources purposes in order to administer benefits to workers and screen
        applicants.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You may contact us in order to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change your preferences with respect
        to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have
        relating to you. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that
        we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior
        to such update, correction, change or deletion.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sale of Business</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of
        all or substantially all of the assets of SEPAL or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that
        portion of SEPAL or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we
        discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or
        similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Affiliates</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For purposes
        of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls,
        is controlled by or is under common control with SEPAL, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information
        relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in
        accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Governing Law</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of India without regard to its conflict of laws provision. You
        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between the
        parties under or in connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights to make
        claims under Privacy Shield, or the Swiss-US framework.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The laws of India, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of the app.
        Your use of the app may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>By using SEPAL or contacting us directly, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree
        to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our website, or use our services. Continued use of the
        website, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not
        significantly affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept those changes.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Your Consent</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We've updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you visit
        our site and how it's being used. By using our app, registering an account, or making a purchase, you hereby
        consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Links to Other Websites</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated
        or controlled by SEPAL. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites,
        and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember
        that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.
        Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our platform, is subject
        to that website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own cookies or other methods to
        collect information about you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Advertising</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This app may contain third party advertisements and links to third party sites. SEPAL does not make any
        representation as to the accuracy or suitability of any of the information contained in those advertisements or
        sites and does not accept any responsibility or liability for the conduct or content of those advertisements and
        sites and the offerings made by the third parties.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Advertising keeps SEPAL and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make sure
        that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Third party advertisements and links to other sites where goods or services are advertised are not endorsements
        or recommendations by SEPAL of the third party sites, goods or services. SEPAL takes no responsibility for the
        content of any of the ads, promises made, or the quality/reliability of the products or services offered in all
        advertisements.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Cookies for Advertising</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>These cookies collect information over time about your online activity on the app and other online services to
        make online advertisements more relevant and effective to you. This is known as interest-based advertising. They
        also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing and ensuring that ads are
        properly displayed for advertisers. Without cookies, it’s really hard for an advertiser to reach its audience,
        or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Cookies</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>SEPAL uses "Cookies" to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A Cookie is a small piece of
        data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to enhance the performance and
        functionality of our app but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain
        functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time
        you visit the app as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously. Most web browsers can
        be set to disable the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access
        functionality on our website correctly or at all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Blocking and disabling cookies and similar technologies</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Wherever you're located you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar technologies, but this action
        may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not be able to
        fully utilize all of its features and services. You should also be aware that you may also lose some saved
        information (e.g. saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different
        browsers make different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the
        cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your
        browser's help menu for more information.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Remarketing Services</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is the
        practice of serving ads across the internet to people who have already visited your website. It allows your
        company to seem like they're “following” people around the internet by serving ads on the websites and platforms
        they use most.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Payment Details</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In respect to any credit card or other payment processing details you have provided us, we commit that this
        confidential information will be stored in the most secure manner possible.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Kids' Privacy</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
        from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided
        Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone
        under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our
        servers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to this Privacy Policy so that they
        accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example,
        through our Service) before we make changes to this Privacy Policy and give you an opportunity to review them
        before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Privacy
        Policy. If you do not want to agree to this or any updated Privacy Policy, you can delete your account.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Third-Party Services</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may display, include or make available third-party content (including data, information, applications and
        other products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services ("Third- Party Services").</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that SEPAL shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their
        accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other
        aspect thereof. SEPAL does not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other
